Jumping on the Clouds Challenge 

In this challenge you recieve two variables. n = the total number of clouds, c = the array of clouds. 
n must be equal to c.length. 
In the array of c, there are 0's and 1's. 0's are clouds you can land on while 1's you must avoid. 
The array of c must always begin and end with 0's and there can never two 1's together. 
The task is to return an interger representing the MINIMUM number of jumps.
